# metadata_date_extract_from_images

This is a quick script on the task I saw for upwork that I didn't manage to get, sadly.
However, I have found it very interesting and decided to make it a side project for portfolio.

TODO:
================
* Add an ability to specify folder location
* Add a check for sorting files based on their extension according to the task description


WHAT WAS DONE SO FAR:
================
* Basic program logic, but it only creates a folder with the file with metadata creation of the it.
